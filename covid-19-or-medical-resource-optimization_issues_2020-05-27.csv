29,https://gitlab.sas.com/covid-19/or/medical-resource-optimization/-/issues/29,Convert fractional values of Length_Stay_Mean to integer in data prep,Closed,"I noticed yesterday that CC's data has fractional values for Length_Stay_Mean, e.g., 4.04, 5.39, etc. Since we are not doing any intra-day scheduling, and we're just counting the total number of customers on each day, we need Length_Stay_Mean to be integer. The optimization doesn't fail if it's fractional, but our TotalPatients impvar is essentially using floor(losMean). For example, if d=5 and losMean=3.8, we're taking sum{d1 in DAYS: 2.6 <= d1 <= 5}, which is equivalent to sum{d1 in DAYS: 3 <= d1 <= 5} since the days are integers, which means we're rounding losMean down to 3. 

```
      impvar TotalPatients{<f,sl,ss,iof,msf,d> in FAC_SLINE_SSERV_IO_MS_DAYS} =
         sum{d1 in DAYS: (max((d - losMean[f,sl,ss,iof,msf] + 1), minDay)) <= d1 <= d} NewPatients[f,sl,ss,iof,msf,d1];
```

At first I thought we should take the ceiling instead of the floor, so that we round 3.8 up to 4. But we probably don't want to round 4.04 up to 5. So another option is to round to the nearest integer. 

For maximum flexibility, I'll add a parameter to cc_data_prep to specify a threshold for the fractional part of Length_Stay_Mean. Values less than the threshold will round down, and values greater than the threshold will round up. This will allow us to use the floor (threshold = 0), ceiling (threshold = 1), round to nearest integer (threshold = 0.5) or any custom rounding (e.g., threshold = 0.2 would round 4.19 down to 4, but round 4.21 up to 5).",micopp,micopp,micopp,micopp,No,No,,2020-05-08 15:51:20,2020-05-13 10:46:08,2020-05-13 10:46:08,,,,0,0

But I'm starting a list of things that we should add to validation for INPUT_OPT_PARAMETERS. If you think of anything else, please add them in comments below. 

1. For the parameters that must have the same value for all scenarios, stop with an error if there is more than one distinct value: planning_horizon, los_rounding_threshold, forecast_model. (This is already in the code.)

2. For values that represent a percent (rapid_test_da, min_demand_ratio, emer_surgical_pts_ratio), make sure they are either 0 or 1 < value <= 100. We should not allow 0 < value <= 1 because it probably means the user misinterpreted the value range, for example if they use 0.3 for 30% when they should use 30. I don't think we have any percent parameters where the user would want to use a value between 0 and 1, except maybe emer_surgical_pts_ratio but if the value is that 
small, they could just use 0 and there probably won't be much difference in the solution. 

3. For parameters that represent a YES/NO value, convert 1 to YES and 0 to NO, and check for any other values that we don't recognize. 

4. For the parameters that ignore hierarchy, make sure there is only one distinct value per scenario: planning_ test_days_ba, rapid_test_ba, date_phase_x, rapid_test_phase_x, not_rapid_tests_phase_x, allow_opening_only_on_phase, secondary_objective_tolerance 

5. Check that they haven’t misspelled any parameter names – look for ones that we don't recognize

6. Figure out what to do with duplicate values within hierarchies for parameters that use the hierarchy: already_open, min_demand_ratio, emer_surgical_pts_ratio


Additional Notes:

A. I am treating TEST_DAYS_BA and RAPID_TEST_BA as if they are not specified by a hierarchy. The current rules that we use for testing rapid and non-rapid patients is not something that will fit into the hierarchy structure, so the rules are still hard-coded in the constraints (e.g., take some non-emergency fraction of surgery patients, or take all inpatients plus some emergency fraction of surgery patients). But the values of TEST_DAYS_BA and RAPID_TEST_BA are changeable in INPUT_OPT_PARAMETERS, you just can't change the sets of patients that they apply to (and therefore you should specify only one value per scenario). 

B. These parameters are still being ignored because we still don't know exactly what they mean: TEST_VISITORS, TEST_FREQ_DAYS, OPEN_FULLY",micopp,micopp,Subramanian Pazhani,supazh,No,No,,2020-05-15 20:36:04,2020-05-20 19:15:32,,,,,0,0

47,https://gitlab.sas.com/covid-19/or/medical-resource-optimization/-/issues/47,Fractional Values for New Patients,Open,"Here are some possible options, with pros and cons: 

1.	Treat NewPatients as continuous during optimization, but then post-process the solution to round fractional values down to the nearest integer. We would need to recompute the KPIs (revenue, margin, resource usage, covid test usage, etc.), but at least this would allow subservices to be open even if the demand is very small for some days. However, if we have a large number of fractional NewPatients values, rounding everything down could result in a significant underutilization of resources, with a corresponding loss of revenue and margin. 

2.	Treat NewPatients as continuous, and do not post-process the solution to round fractional values. (This is basically what we have today without the INTEGER specification on NewPatients.) Advise CC that the NewPatients values should be used as a guidance for how many patients to admit, but obviously not exact. So if they see, for example, 15.36 NewPatients, they might decide to admit “somewhere around 15”. If they see 0.4 NewPatients on Monday, they might decide not to admit any new patients on Monday – but if they see 0.4 NewPatients on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, then they might decide to admit 2 new patients that week – and they can decide the days, depending on resource availability. In other words, our recommendations will primarily be for when each subservice should open, and general guidelines about the approximate volume of patients to admit on each day, but not for specific patient volumes (which they would have to adjust anyway if their actual demand doesn’t match forecasted demand). 

3.	Treat NewPatients as integer, but modify the Min Demand constraints in some way so that we aren’t preventing a service from being open if the demand is too small to be satisfied with a positive integer value. For example, we could add a threshold such that we only apply the Min Demand constraint when the demand forecast is larger than some number. Or maybe we adjust the RHS of the Min Demand constraint to be the floor of MIN_DEMAND_RATIO * forecasted demand. The advantage of this approach is that we can give them an integer solution. The disadvantage is that it makes the interpretation of MIN_DEMAND_RATIO a bit more confusing, so we would need to make sure they understand how we’re going to apply it. And it might result in underutilization of resources (with corresponding decrease in revenue and margin) if we have a lot of small fractional demand that now becomes zero.

Hold NON_RAPID tests: from 0 to all by 200
Hold Rapid tests: from 0 by 200

I'd like to see all the combinations (cartesian product outputs).

The output table that would be super useful for me would be:
Num_Rapid_Held (numeric column), Num_Non_Rapid_Held (numeric column), Facility, Service, Sub_Service, IP, MED_Surg, Revenue, Margin, New Patients

So you could probably post-process OUTPUT_OPT_DETAIL.
