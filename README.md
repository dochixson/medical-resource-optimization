# Medical Resource Optimization

## Introduction to the problem
The model environment or the problem environment has medical facilities, services lines at each facility, and sub-services at each facility and service line. Along with this the services offered for patients at each of these sub-services is categorized as inpatient/outpatient and medical/surgical. The sub-services are currently closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Opening all the sub-services is not feasible due to shared resource constraints, like COVID-19 test kits, ventilators, shared beds, operating rooms, etc. Given the forecasted demand and resource availability, our objective of this project is to recommend an optimal reopening plan for the medical facilities. The model uses two objectives, maximize revenue and maximize margin. However, other objectives like maximize number of patients serviced, weighted by service criticality can be considered as future extensions.  

## Hierarchy definition
Our hierarchy in the model is facility, service line, sub-service, inpatient/outpatient flag, and medical/surgical indicator. All our data parameters, except some global model run parameters, are defined within this hierarchy. 

## Input files
The model has 7 input tables and they are defined within the hierarchy definition:
1. input_capacity: This table contains the capacity available for resources at each facility, services, and sub-services hierarchy. 'ALL' is used to denote resources shared across multiple sub-services/service lines/facilities. 
2. input_utilization: This table contains the utilization (or usage) of each resource per patient per day, by inpatient/outpatient and medical/surgical indicators, at each facility, services, and sub-services hierarchy. 
3. input_service_attributes: This table contains the service attributes like average length of stay (in days) of a patient, by inpatient/outpatient and medical/surgical indicators, at each facility, services, and sub-services hierarchy. 
4. input_financials: This table contains the revenue and margin data, by inpatient/outpatient and medical/surgical indicators, at each facility, services, and sub-services hierarchy. 
5. input_demand: This table contains the historical demand data, by inpatient/outpatient and medical/surgical indicators, at each facility, services, and sub-services hierarchy. This data is used to forecast demand to be used by the optimization model. The input_demand table is not required if the input_demand_forecast table is used.
6. input_demand_forecast: This table contains the forecasted demand data, by inpatient/outpatient and medical/surgical indicators, at each facility, services, and sub-services hierarchy. The input_demand_forecast table is not required if the input_demand table is used.
7. input_opt_parameters: This table contains a set of parameters for the users to control when submitting optimization jobs. For example, one of the parameters is PLANNING_HORIZON which defines the planning horizon (in weeks) for the forecasting and optimization model. A complete list of parameters is shown below in Table 1:

# Scenario runs

The optimization model is capable of running multiple scenarios with different parameter settings. One example of such scenario is change in COVID-19 test kit numbers. Users can define two scenarios with current and modified set of COVID19 test kit numbers. 

Note that not all parameters can be changed across scenarios. Please refer to Table 1. The parameters tagged as *(Global)* cannot be changed across scenarios. Other parameters which are tagged as *(Scenario)* can be changed across scenarios. Note that the model will stop if the data contains different values for *(Global)* parameters across scenarios. 

## Model files

This section will describe the model files. 

- **cc_data_prep** : is a macro to pre-processes the data files, to clean invalid entries and duplicate entries. Invalid entries are the data entries which are not consistent under the defined hierarchy. The macro takes all the input files (input_capacity, input_demand, input_demand_forecast, input_financials, input_service_attributes, input_utilization, input_opt_parameters) and creates clean input files, as the output, to be used by subsequent models (forecasting and optimization model). 
Note that there are two input demand files - historical demand data and forecasted demand data. One of these files is pre-processed and used as the demand file based on a parameter in the input_opt_parameters table. 

- **cc_forecast_demand** : is a macro which,
(1) takes in historical demand values (input_demand) by inpatient/outpatient and medical/surgical categories, at each facility, services, and sub-services hierarchy and creates a forecasted demand for the defined planning horizon. The macro gives two options to generate forecast - time series model (or) year-over-year method. The selection of the forecast method can be done using a parameter in input_opt_parameters. 
(2) takes in input_demand_forecast and sets it as forecasted demand.

- **cc_optimize** : is the optimization code. This macro reads the pre-processed input files from the cc_data_prep macro and forecasted demand file from the cc_forecast-demand macro. It then generates the optimization model, solves the model, and creates various output tables like reopening plan, resource usage etc.  
The optimization model can be accessed from this link.  

- **cc_execute** : is a macro which executes the *cc_data_prep*, *cc_forecast_demand*, and *cc_optimize* macros in sequence.  

- **cc_standalone.sas** : is the file which calls the *cc_execute* macro and passes relevant parameters to run the *cc_data_prep*, *cc_forecast_demand*, and *cc_optimize* macros. 

## Output files

**Output files from *cc_data_prep* are as follows:**
- OUTPUT_DP_DUPLICATE_ROWS - has details of the duplicate entries in the tables along with hierarchy information. 
- OUTPUT_DP_HIERARCHY_MISMATCH - has details of hierarchy defined in one table and not in others. 
- OUTPUT_DP_INVALID_VALUES - has details of the invalid data values in the tables along with hierarchy information.
- OUTPUT_DP_RESOURCE_MISMATCH - has details on the mismatch between input_capacity and input_utilization tables. Resource specific data (availability and usage) should be defined in both of these tables in order to be used in the model.

**Output file from *cc_forecast_demand* are as follows:**
- OUTPUT_FD_DEMAND_FCST - forecasted demand for the planning horizon either from the external forecast file or forecasted data from the provided historical demand data. 

**Output file from *cc_optimize* are as follows:**
- OUTPUT_OPT_DETAIL - shows the optimization model output such as patients accepted, margin, revenue by scenario, day, and hierarchy.
- OUTPUT_OPT_DETAIL_AGG - shows the weekly aggregated optimization model output such as average daily patients accepted, average daily margin, average daily revenue by scenario, week, and hierarchy.
- OUTPUT_OPT_SUMMARY - shows the reopening plan for the sub-services at each facility and service line. 
- OUTPUT_OPT_RESOURCE_USAGE - shows the utilization of the resource at the granularity of the resource capacity definition.
- OUTPUT_OPT_RESOURCE_USAGE_DETAIL - shows the utilization of the resource as the fraction of resource used at a sub-service in facility/service line. 
- OUTPUT_OPT_COVID_TEST_USAGE - shows the used vs. available COVID-19 test kits by scenario, day, and hierarchy.

## Procedure to execute the code

Before you run the code:
1. Create a global CASlib called COVID
2. Upload the input files to the COVID CASlib. 

Below is the step-by-step procedure to run the code:

1. Download the codes from Gitlab (described in the *Model files* section) to a folder on your machine. Have all the codes in the same folder. The folder location should be accessible from SAS Studio. 
2. Open the *cc_standalone.sas* file 
   * modify the *my_code_path* variable to path of the folder where you downloaded the Model files.
   * modify the input macro variables in the %cc_execute macro call.

        - outlib = the name of the library where the output tables will be stored.
        - opt_param_lib = the name of the library where the INPUT_OPT_PARAMETERS table will be available.
        - _worklib = the name of the library where the working tables will be stored. Working tables will be automatically deleted at the end of the program execution. 
        - input_utilization= the name of the table where input_utilization data resides (in inlib).
        - input_capacity= the name of the table where input_capacity data resides (in inlib).

        - output_opt_covid_test_usage=the name of the table where output_opt_covid_test_usage data needs to be stored (in outlib)
        - run_dp = is set to 1 if *cc_data_prep.sas* macro is to be executed, 0 otherwise
        - run_fcst = is set to 1 if *cc_forecast_demand.sas* macro code is to be executed, 0 otherwise
        - run_opt = is set to 1 if *cc_optimize.sas* macro code is to be executed, 0 otherwise
        - debug = is a optional parameter. Set to 1 if you want to retain the temporary working tables for debugging.  
3. Run the *cc_standalone.sas* code. The *cc_standalone.sas* file calls and runs the *cc_execute.sas* macro. The *cc_execute.sas* macro runs *cc_data_prep.sas*, *cc_forecast_demand*, and *cc_optimize* macros in sequence.  
4. Output files can be accessed from outlib.
